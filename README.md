iOS demo project about UI experiments.
- Core Animation
- Core Motion
- LED light

Deployment target: 7.0
Devices: iPhone
SDK: 8.1

It`s OK to launch it on simulator, because there is some kind of stub simulating Core Motion events (just to show animations), but I highly suggest to check it on real devices. LED is also unavailable on sim.

Oh, almost forgot: MRC.
